      <h1>Ingredients</h1>
      <p>3 (about 4-ounce) poblano chiles</p>
      <p>1 (28-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes (undrained)</p>
      <p>3 tablespoons neutral oil</p>
      <p>1 small white onion, thinly sliced (about 2 cups)</p>
      <p>2 fresh or dried bay leaves</p>
      <p>1 garlic clove, grated</p>
      <p>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided, plus more to taste</p>
      <p>1/2 teaspoon black pepper, divided, plus more to taste</p>
      <p>1/4 teaspoon dried marjoram</p>
      <p>8 large eggs</p>
      <p>Crumbled queso fresco and cilantro sprigs, for garnish</p>
      <p>Warm corn tortillas, for serving</p>
    </div>
    <div class="steps">
      <h1>Step 1</h1>
      Char poblanos directly over flame of a gas stovetop until skin is blackened, 2 to 3 minutes per side. (Alternatively, broil chiles on a baking sheet 6 inches from heat source until charred, about 5 minutes per side.) Transfer to a large bowl, and cover with plastic wrap; let stand 10 minutes. Rub off skins from chiles, removing as much blackened skin as possible. Remove and discard stems and seeds. Slice chiles into 2- x 1/2-inch strips; set aside.
      <h1>Step 2</h1>
      Drain tomatoes, reserving juices in a medium bowl. Roughly chop tomatoes, and place in bowl with reserved juices. Set aside.
      <h1>Step3</h1>
      Heat oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium. Add onion, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 4 to 6 minutes. Add poblano strips, and cook, stirring occasionally, until excess liquid is evaporated, about 2 minutes. Add reserved tomatoes and juices, bay leaves, garlic, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and marjoram. Bring to a boil over medium. Cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce is very thick, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove and discard bay leaves. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.
      <h1>Step4</h1>
      Decrease heat to medium-low. Crack eggs into skillet about 1 inch apart. Sprinkle eggs evenly with remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and remaining 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Cover skillet, and cook until egg whites are set and yolks are still runny, 4 to 5 minutes. Garnish with queso fresco and cilantro. Serve immediately with corn tortillas.
